            <h2 class="footer-ques">What is percentage calculator ?</h2>
            <p class="footer-ans-data">
              In mathematics, a percentage is a number or ratio that represents
              a fraction of 100. It is often denoted by the symbol "%" or simply
              as "percent" or "pct." For example, 35% is equivalent to the
              decimal 0.35, or the fraction 35 100.
            </p>
            <h2 class="footer-ques">What is Percentage Formula ?</h2>
            <p class="footer-ans-data">
              Although the percentage formula can be written in different forms,
              it is essentially an algebraic equation involving three values. P
              × V1 = V2 P is the percentage, V1 is the first value that the
              percentage will modify, and V2 is the result of the percentage
              operating on V1. The calculator provided automatically converts
              the input percentage into a decimal to compute the solution.
              However, if solving for the percentage, the value returned will be
              the actual percentage, not its decimal representation. EX: P × 30
              = 1.5 P = 1.5 30 = 0.05 × 100 = 5% If solving manually, the
              formula requires the percentage in decimal form, so the solution
              for P needs to be multiplied by 100 in order to convert it to a
              percent. This is essentially what the calculator above does,
              except that it accepts inputs in percent rather than decimal form.
            </p>
            <h2 class="footer-ques">What is Percentage Difference Formula</h2>
            <p class="footer-ans-data">
              The percentage difference between two values is calculated by
              dividing the absolute value of the difference between two numbers
              by the average of those two numbers. Multiplying the result by 100
              will yield the solution in percent, rather than decimal form.
              Refer to the equation below for clarification. Percentage
              Difference = |V1 - V2| (V1 + V2)/2 × 100 EX: |10 - 6| (10 + 6)/2 =
              4 8 = 0.5 = 50%
            </p>
            <h2 class="footer-ques">What is Percentage Change Formula ?</h2>
            <p class="footer-ans-data">
              Percentage increase and decrease are calculated by computing the
              difference between two values and comparing that difference to the
              initial value. Mathematically, this involves using the absolute
              value of the difference between two values, and dividing the
              result by the initial value, essentially calculating how much the
              initial value has changed. The percentage increase calculator
              above computes an increase or decrease of a specific percentage of
              the input number. It basically involves converting a percent into
              its decimal equivalent, and either subtracting (decrease) or
              adding (increase) the decimal equivalent from and to 1,
              respectively. Multiplying the original number by this value will
              result in either an increase or decrease of the number by the
              given percent. Refer to the example below for clarification. EX:
              500 increased by 10% (0.1) 500 × (1 + 0.1) = 550 500 decreased by
              10% 500 × (1 – 0.1) = 450
