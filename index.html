              How to use the Percentage calculator website ?
            </h2>
            <p class="footer-ans-data">

              interface. Simply enter the numbers for which you need to

            <h2 class="footer-ques">What is Percentage Formula ?</h2>
            <p class="footer-ans-data">
              Percentage formula helps you determine the percentage of a number
              with respect to another number, and express the result as a
              dimensionless ratio between the two numbers. If you need to find
              <i>b</i> % of a number <i>a</i>, then <i>b</i> is multiplied by
              <i>a</i> and divided by 100, to get the <i>b%</i> of <i>a</i>. If
              you want to find 30% of 200, this percentage calculator tool works
              by multiplying 30 and 200, and then dividing the result by 100
              which would give you the answer as 60. In case you need to
              calculate how much percentage of a number <i>a</i> is <i>b</i>,
              then <i>b</i> is divided by <i>a</i> and multiplied by 100, to get
              the result. For example, to find how much percentage of 75 is 25,
              divide 25 by 75 and multiply by 100, which would give the answer
              33.33 %.
            </p>

            <h2 class="footer-ques">What is Percentage Change Formula ?</h2>
            <p class="footer-ans-data">
              My percentage calculator also works as a percentage change
              calculator, to help you quantify the increase/decrease from one
              number to another, and give you this change in terms of percentage
              difference. i.e this tool helps you to find the percentage
              increase or percentage decrease between two numbers. If you want
              to find the percentage change of a number <i>a</i> to a number
              <i>b</i>, then the difference between the two numbers is
              calculated and divided by <i>b</i>, and then multiplied by 100.
              For example, if you want to find the percentage increase or
              decrease of 75 to 125, then the difference between the two numbers
              are calculated, divided by 125 and multiplied by 100, to get the
              result 66.66%.
